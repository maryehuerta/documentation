Synthify.me will get playlists from a user from each platform, and bring them all together and have the playlists unified under one service. The service will auto-update after a certain amount of time to make sure it's consistent with any playlist changes that the user may have done on the respective platform. The "look and feel" of Synthify.me is similar to Spotifiy's dashboard. Users should expect to listen to music from each platform they have signed up for.
